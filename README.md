# C Compiler

This is a project where I stich together open-source compiler libraries to familiarize myself with compilers libraries & development.

## Libraries Used, and how to install

The following libraries can just do the `sudo cmake install` rodeo. Build from source.

### [PegLib](https://github.com/yhirose/cpp-peglib)

### [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest)

### LLVM-10

This one was just sudo apt installing llvm-10
