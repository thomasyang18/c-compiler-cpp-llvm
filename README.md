# C Compiler

This is a project where I stich together open-source compiler libraries to familiarize myself with the ecosystem. Theory is nice and all, but no one wants to be rewriting compilers from scratch every time.

## Libraries Used, and how to install

The following libraries can just do the `sudo cmake install` rodeo. Build from source.

### [PegLib](https://github.com/yhirose/cpp-peglib)

### [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest)

### LLVM

I suspect this is the same thing, but I'll do a fresh install/build just to make sure, since it *may* be because I just apt-installed this instead of building from source.
